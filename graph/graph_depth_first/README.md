# Code Challenge 38

Write the following method for the Graph class:

    - Name: Depth first
    - Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
    - Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
    - Program output: Display the collection

## Approach & Efficiency

Classes, loops, conditionals.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges in the graph.

Space Complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
