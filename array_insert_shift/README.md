# Code Challenge: Class 02

Write out code as part of your whiteboard process.

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Whiteboard Process

![Whiteboard 2](../assets/Wireframe-2.jpg "whiteboard").

## Approach & Efficiency

Loops, indexes.

The time complexity is O(l):because the function iterates through l/2 of the array in the worst case, so it depends on the array length.

The space complexity is O(1): it only uses a few constant-sized variables to perform the array shift and insert.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
For later.
